 * The core service providing the business logic for the application. The basic
 * structure is that this service maps between "public" paths and actual files
 * on the file system. Different users can have different public paths actually
 * pointing to the same actual file. The public path always starts with a root
 * dir as returned by {@link #getRootDirectories()}. Each root dir is publicly
 * just a name, whereas the implementation of this class will map that to actual
 * resources.
 * <p>
 * Each root dir can then contain additional directories, as well as files. In
 * the interest of this service, there are images and videos.
